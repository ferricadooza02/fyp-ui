      "The NVIDIA T4 GPU is a mid-range accelerator designed for inference tasks, light training, and AI workloads. It is optimised for lower power consumption while still delivering good performance for models up to a few billion parameters. The T4 is widely used for cost-effective and energy-efficient workloads, especially in cloud environments like Google Colab, where emissions are often tied to regional data centre efficiency. Its lower computational power relative to the more advanced GPUs means that while it uses less energy and emits less CO₂ per second, it takes longer to complete fine-tuning tasks, potentially balancing out its overall emissions.",

It offers better performance than the T4 but remains energy-efficient. The L4 strikes a balance between the cost-effectiveness of the T4 and the power of the A100, making it suitable for both training and inference tasks across various AI domains. This GPU is often used in enterprise settings where energy efficiency and scalability are important.",

It offers significantly higher computational power, making it ideal for training large models like those in natural language processing. The A100 supports tensor cores that accelerate AI workloads, drastically reducing the time required for tasks like model fine-tuning. Despite its powerful performance, the A100 consumes more energy and emits more CO₂ per second, leading to higher emissions rates when compared to T4 and L4. However, its shorter runtime for completing tasks often offsets its higher per-second emissions.",
